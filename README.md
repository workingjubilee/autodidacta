# autodidacta

This is a mega-repository for ongoing self-study subjects not considered divisible into their own projects. Expect it to contain many "hello worlds" and disorganized notes.
I primarily engage in this kind of exploration on repl.it but sometimes I just need to make an entire folder for it, and that's what this is for.

##elixir

Referenced primarily from https://elixirschool.com/en/

## python

Primarily self-study with Learn Python the Hard Way.

## reason-ml

ReasonML, primarily from documentation.

# autodidacta

This is a mega-repository for ongoing self-study subjects not considered divisible into their own projects. Expect it to contain many "hello worlds" and disorganized notes.
I primarily engage in this kind of exploration on repl.it but sometimes I just need to make an entire folder for it, and that's what this is for.

## reason-ml

ReasonML, primarily from documentation.
